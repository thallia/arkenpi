To install the Adafruit PiTFT under Raspbian Jessie on a Raspberry Pi 3
Last updated 03/19/2016 1830 MJCulross (KD5RXT)

[ NOTE: I am specifically using the Adafruit 320x240 2.8" TFT + Resistive Touchscreen - Product ID: 2298 ]

- download the latest Raspbian Jessie image [currently 03-18-2016]

   https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest

- burn the latest Raspbian Jessie image into a microSD [I use a 32GB microSD] using Win32DiskImager

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download

- boot Raspbian Jessie & open a terminal window

- make sure that your Raspberry Pi is connected to a network [wired connection preferred at this point]

- change to the root account as follows:

   sudo su -

- change the default root account password as follows:

   passwd

- run the following [to configure the runtime environment]:

   raspi-config

- choose to expand the filesystem to fill the microSD

- change the default pi account password

- change the Boot Options to Console

- enable Wait for Network at Boot

- change Internationalization Options Locale to remove en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8 & add en_US ISO-8859-1

- change the default locale to en_us

- change Internationalization Options Timezone to US Central [for Dallas/Fort Worth]

- change Internationalization Options Keyboard to [whatever your system detects - mine is Generic 105-key PC, English (US), The default for the keyboard layout, No compose key, Yes to enable Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to terminate the Xserver]

- change Internationalization Options Wi-fi Country to US [for Dallas/Fort Worth]

- change Advanced Options to set the hostname

- change Advanced Options to enable SSH

- select <Finish> & <Yes> to reboot [to apply the changes and expand the filesystem to fill the microSD]

- login as root (with the password set earlier)

- run the following [to configure the runtime environment]:

   raspi-config

- select Advanced Options Update

- select <Finish> to exit

- run the following [to update to the latest packages]:

   apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade

- download the rpi-source utility as follows:

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source -O /usr/bin/rpi-source
   chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-source
   /usr/bin/rpi-source -q --tag-update

- run the rpi-source utility as follows [to download the kernel sources]:

   rpi-source

- run the following [to update to the latest packages]:

   apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade

- make a build directory for the rpi-power-switch module & change to it as follows:

   mkdir ./rpi_power_switch
   cd ./rpi_power_switch

- download the source & Makefile for rpi_power_switch as follows:

   wget https://github.com/notro/fbtft_tools/raw/master/rpi_power_switch/rpi_power_switch.c
   wget https://github.com/notro/fbtft_tools/raw/master/rpi_power_switch/Makefile

- build the rpi_power_switch kernel module as follows:

   make

- install the rpi_power_switch kernel module as follows [& move it to the extra folder for the running kernel]:

   make install
   mkdir /lib/modules/4.1.19-v7+/extra
   cp /lib/modules/4.1.19+-v7/extra/rpi_power_switch.ko /lib/modules/4.1.19-v7+/extra/
   depmod
   
- load the rpi_power_switch module to test it as follows [use the gpio_pin of your choice - I used 27]:

   modprobe rpi_power_switch gpio_pin=27

- check to verify that the module was loaded as follows [should return "rpi_power_switch        3267 0"]:

   lsmod | grep rpi_power_switch

- change back to the home directory for the root account as follows:

   cd

- download the adafruit-pitft-helper utility as follows:

   wget https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PiTFT-Helper/raw/master/adafruit-pitft-helper

- run the adafruit-pitft-helper utility [I selected "y" (console on PiTFT), "y" (GPIO 23 as on/off)]

   chmod +x ./adafruit-pitft-helper
   ./adafruit-pitft-helper -t 28r

- edit /boot/config.txt & change the following [to update to the new overlay name]:

   dtoverlay=pitft28r,rotate=90,speed=32000000,fps=20  ==>> dtoverlay=pitft28-resistive,rotate=90,speed=32000000,fps=20

- edit /etc/modprobe.d/adafruit.conf & change the following [to update to your gpio_pin number - I used 27]:

   options rpi_power_switch gpio_pin=23 mode=0 ==>> options rpi_power_switch gpio_pin=27 mode=0

- edit /etc/default/console-setup & change the FONTFACE & FONTSIZE to the following [to use a smaller & more readable font]:

   FONTFACE="Terminus"
   FONTSIZE="6x12"

- reboot to make everything active as follows:

   shutdown -r now

- if you prefer to boot to the console & start the Xserver manually, you have the following options available (as it is currently configured):

   - move the fbdev.conf file to disable it as follows:

      mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.disabled

   - start X on the HDMI display as follows:

      FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb0 startx

   - start X on the PiTFT display as follows:

      FRAMEBUFFER=/dev/fb1 startx

   - in either case, to exit back to the console, press Ctrl-Alt-Backspace [NOTE: the RPi graphics will remain (but disabled) when using the HDMI display]

- if you'd like to always have the Xserver startup, perform the following:

   - if you previously moved the fbdev.conf file to disable, move it back as follows:

      mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.disabled /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf

   - run the raspi-config utility as follows:

      raspi-config

   - change the Boot Options to Desktop

- to cleanly power down your Raspberry Pi, momentarily press your selected gpio_pin to initiate a clean shutdown

- to cleanly restart your Raspberry Pi, press and hold your selected gpio_pin to initiate a clean reboot . . . continue holding until reboot starts

- congratulations . . . you have successfully built & installed support for the Adafruit PiTFT & rpi_power_switch under Raspbian Jessie on a Raspberry Pi 3
